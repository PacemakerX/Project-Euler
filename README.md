This repository contains all my **accepted solutions** for Project Euler problems submitted on [HackerRank Project Euler Contest](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges). It's a comprehensive archive to track my mathematical and algorithmic problem-solving journey and help others learn from my solutions.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Collection**: Solutions to Project Euler problems available on HackerRank.
- **Organized Structure**: Files are named by problem number and title, e.g.:
  - `001_Multiples_of_3_and_5.cpp`
  - `002_Even_Fibonacci_numbers.cpp`
- **Input/Output**: Sample inputs and outputs are provided in the `outputs/` folder.
- **Scripts**: Utility scripts for compiling and running solutions are in the `scripts/` folder.

## Why This Repository?

This repository serves as:

- A personal archive of my progress on Project Euler.
- A reference for others aiming to learn mathematical problem solving and algorithms.
- A source of well-documented approaches to classic computational problems.

## Tech

Solutions are written in:

- **C++**
